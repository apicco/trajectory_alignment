Welcome to the `trajalign` module distribution homepage! 
`trajalign` is a collection of Python modules that align in space and in time, and average, trajectories of diffraction limited object, which are recorded with fluorescence microscopy.

![example](images/plot.png)
*The inward movement of the endocytic coat protein Sla1 during endocytosis. 67 independet  trajectories are aligned in space and time and averaged together, with `trajalign` module distribution. Generate this plot by following this [example](wiki/Averaging-trajectories-example).* 

You can [**Download**](https://github.com/apicco/trajectory_alignment/archive/master.zip) the software or visit the [github repository](https://github.com/apicco/trajectory_alignment/). If you already have downloaded `trajalign` you might want to check the [update](https://github.com/apicco/trajectory_alignment/commits/master) history to see whether significant changes have been committed to the repository since your last download.

To [install](wiki/Installation) and use the package read the [documentation](wiki/Home).
